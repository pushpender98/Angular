# Angular

I have learned, so far are as follows...

- Create Custom Component 
- Create Comeponent using command 
- Data Binding
    - String Interpolation 
        => Syntax: {{ varibale name  }}
    - Property Interpolation
        => Syntax: [property like innerText] = ""
    - Event Bindings
        => Syntax: (event like click) = "<function name>"
    - Two Way Bindings 
        => Syntax: [(ngmodel)] = "What we want to do"
